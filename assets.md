# About Section
BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN DATA AND ACTION. APIS. INSIGHTS. CLOUD.

Driven by a desire to make a difference, I translate data into actionable insights that empower positive change. I develop APIs that bridge the gap between applications and databases then leverage data to drive informed decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately boost business performance & powered by cloud-based infrastructure.

Beyond the realm of Coding, I actively contribute to vibrant tech communities, participating in Scientific Clubs like Alphabit Club and Google Developer Student Clubs.
